## Run the dev server

Run `go run ./cmd/server` from the `server` directory.
Run `ng serve` inside `tasks-web-client`.

The Go server reverse proxies the requests to the Angular development server.
This way we don't have to deal with CORS.

## API Bindings

Run `bindings.sh` in the root directory.
